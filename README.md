# Who travels more? ‚úàÔ∏èüß≥üó∫Ô∏è

Traveling is one of the things I love the most! So I decided to create a project on traveling - everything I can find about traveling - who leads the scoreboard, how do they travel, how much to they spend, where do they stay? This is an ongoing exploration, so make sure to come back for updates!
So far this is what I've found:

1) The script entitled "holiday packages" answers the question of who holidays more by exploring a dataset of number of trips by working men and women.
I found out that:
- single men working in large business are the globetrotters! They make an average of 4.4 trips a year, followed by unmarried women who make about 3.9 trips a year. Interestingly, single women from large businesses travel only 2.7 times a year (at the bottom of our list).
- divorced women who work in large business are the ones who travel less - making only 2.5 trips a year! In contrast, divorced men who work in large business travel 3.8 times in a year, coming in third place in our list! 

You can find a Tableau interactive visualisation I created [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bruna.tessaro2596/viz/whotravelsmore/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

These results corroborate [previous ones](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/issj.12391#:~:text=The%20obtained%20results%20confirm%20the,for%20purposes%20other%20than%20work.).

Well, it looks like another gender gap is found in traveling and exploring the world. Perhaps this is a consequence of the gender pay gap, although many other variables could play an important part such as [women being the primary childcarers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-020-09742-4). 

2) The script entitled traveler-trip explores a dataset that contains travel history details of 139 people from all over the world. So far this is what I found:
