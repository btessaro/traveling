# Who travels more? ✈️🧳🗺️

This script answers the question of who travels more by exploring a dataset of number of trips by working men and women.

I found out that:
- single men working in large business are the globetrotters! They make an average of 4.4 trips a year, followed by unmarried women who make about 3.9 trips a year. Interestingly, single women from large businesses travel only 2.7 times a year (at the bottom of our list).
- divorced women who work in large business are the ones who travel less - making only 2.5 trips a year! In contrast, divorced men who work in large business travel 3.8 times in a year, coming in third place in our list! 

These results corroborate [previous ones](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/issj.12391#:~:text=The%20obtained%20results%20confirm%20the,for%20purposes%20other%20than%20work.).

Well, it looks like another gender gap is found in traveling and exploring the world. Perhaps this is a consequence of the gender pay gap, although many other variables could play an important part such as [women being the primary childcarers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-020-09742-4).
